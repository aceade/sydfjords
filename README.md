# Sydfjords Tourism Page
A practice project to teach myself responsive web design with Vue. The concept here is a tourism page for a fictional region inspired by Patagonia and Iceland, using [this project](https://www.frontendpractice.com/projects/monogram) as a springboard.

## Building

This uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) instead of npm. However, most of the commands should work roughly the same.

- `pnpm install` installs dependencies. Unlike npm, it relies on 
- `pnpm run dev` runs a development build.
- `pnpm run build` runs a production build. This is also used during the automated deploy.
